// One cell of the photo grid. .photo-slot and friends from components.html
// section 10. PhotoGrid owns the layout and the rules; this draws one slot.
//
// CHANGED FROM components.html, all four agreed on screen with Amna:
//  - the slot and its overlay controls are <button>s, not <div>s, so they can
//    be tabbed to and used without a mouse. The remove control is a sibling
//    positioned over the slot, because a button cannot contain another button.
//  - the remove control draws its X from the icon set. A "times" glyph is
//    centred on its own typographic box rather than on the circle, which is
//    why it always sat slightly high and to the left.
//  - selecting a photo draws no outline on the tile. The only thing that
//    changes is the "Set as cover" bar, inverted to white on black.
//  - the cover badge is a small white pill in the bottom-left corner at 12px
//    radius, not a black bar across the full width.
