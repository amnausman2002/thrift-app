# Reloved

Mobile-first web app for buying and selling preloved women's clothing in Pakistan.
Built by two product designers, Amna and Bismah, in five weeks. Soft launch in week 3.
Entered in the Google Cloud AI Builder Cup (Retail & Commerce track). Prototype due 18 October.

**North star:** A woman anywhere in Pakistan finds a preloved item in her size and brand,
and messages the seller on WhatsApp in under two minutes.
If a feature does not shorten that distance, it is not in v1.

The full spec is in `docs/PRD.md`. Read the relevant section before building any feature.
The technical plan for the seller flow (photo upload, Gemini calls, accounts, build order) is in
`docs/seller-flow-research.md`. Read it before touching anything in `app/sell/`, `lib/ai/` or `app/api/ai/`.
If this file and the PRD disagree, stop and ask us.

## Competition rules (non-negotiable)

- Every AI feature uses Google's Gemini models. Never call Anthropic, OpenAI or any other model provider from the app.
- Everything runs on Google Cloud / Firebase. Do not add services hosted elsewhere (no Vercel, Supabase, AWS, etc.).
- The app deploys on Firebase App Hosting, which runs on Cloud Run.
- This is a fresh project built during the hackathon. Do not copy in code from other projects.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript
- Plain global CSS in `app/globals.css`, class names matching `components.html` exactly. **Tailwind was dropped:** the design system already existed as vanilla CSS with custom properties, so converting it would have added a package and a chance to drift. Fonts via `next/font/google`, self-hosted at build time
- Firebase Authentication: email link sign-in for everyone, phone verification by SMS code for sellers
- Cloud Firestore for data
- Cloud Storage for Firebase for listing photos
- Gemini through the Google Gen AI library (`@google/genai`) on Vertex AI, called only from server code
- Firebase Trigger Email extension for emails to sellers and reporters (Google is retiring Firebase Extensions in March 2027, which is fine for the prototype)
- Firebase App Hosting for deployment

### Gemini settings (easy to get wrong)

- **Model:** `gemini-3.8-flash`, read from the environment variable `GEMINI_MODEL`. Never hard-code the model name in more than one place.
- **Do not use Gemini 2.5 models.** Google retires them on 16 to 20 October 2026, around our deadline.
- **Location must be `global`** (environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`). Gemini 3.x models return a 404 error at `us-central1`.
- Gemini model names change often and 3.8 Flash may be retired on short notice. Before writing or changing any model name, check Google's current documentation, and tell us if the name is out of date.
- **No API keys anywhere.** On a laptop the server signs in through Application Default Credentials (`gcloud auth application-default login`). On App Hosting it uses the service account `firebase-app-hosting-compute@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, which needs the role `roles/aiplatform.user`.
- Gemini is called only from server routes. Never from the browser.
- Use the `thinkingLevel` setting `LOW` (3.8 Flash does not accept `MINIMAL`), and do not set a low temperature.
- Some setting names differ between versions of the Gen AI library (for example `responseSchema` vs `responseJsonSchema`). Check the installed version's types before writing calls.
- Validate every Gemini answer with Zod (a data-checking library) before using it. Never trust the shape of the model's output.

## Commands

Gemini setup on a laptop (run once):

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

Environment variables in `.env.local` (never committed, listed without values in `.env.example`):
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`, `GEMINI_MODEL`.

Day to day:

```
npm install                      First time, and after pulling new packages
npm run dev                      Starts the app at http://localhost:3000
npm run build                    Production build. Run before claiming anything works
npx tsc --noEmit                 Type check on its own
npm run try-prefill -- ./photos  Runs a folder of photos through Call 1, prints a table
```

Check Gemini is reachable: open `http://localhost:3000/api/health/gemini`. It should
return `{"ok":true,...,"reply":"ok"}`. If it does not, your login has probably expired —
run `gcloud auth application-default login` again.

Try the seller AI by hand: `http://localhost:3000/dev/prefill` (development only, 404s in production).

TODO: deploy commands, once App Hosting is set up.

Planned but not created yet, so do not expect to find them: `components/`, `lib/firebase/`,

`app/admin/`, `eval/items.csv`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## How to work with us

- We are product designers, not developers. Before a technical decision, explain it in one or two plain-language sentences.
- Ask before installing any new package or adding any new Google Cloud or Firebase service.
- Keep changes small: one feature per branch, commit working states often.
- For anything bigger than a small edit, propose a plan first and wait for us to say go.
- If a request contradicts the PRD or the anti-goals below, say so instead of building it.
- Never commit secrets. Keys live in environment variables, listed without values in `.env.example`.
- Do not change files outside the current person's area without saying so first (see Ownership).
- When something breaks, explain the error in plain language before changing any code.

## Ownership

- **Amna, seller side and admin:** sell flow, photo to listing, photo quality check, seller's own listings, admin queue, reports, approval copilot, catalogue-photo detection
- **Bismah, buyer side:** homepage, browse, filters, natural-language search, item detail, WhatsApp contact, seller public profile
- **Shared (ask before changing, and note it in the daily handoff):** design tokens, `components/ui/`, the data model, Firestore security rules, `lib/ai/client.ts` and `lib/ai/schemas.ts`, `lib/constants.ts`

---

## Anti-goals: do not build these, even if they seem helpful

1. In-app chat or messaging. WhatsApp carries the conversation.
2. Automated reminder messages to sellers.
3. Seller reviews or ratings. The sold count is the trust signal.
4. Saved searches or new-stock alerts.
5. AI that approves, rejects or hides anything.
6. Duplicate-listing detection. The admin queue is the check.
7. In-app payments or shipping.
8. A native mobile app. Mobile web only.
9. Commission or listing fees.
10. Categories outside the fixed list: no wedding or formal wear, kidswear, menswear, unstitched fabric, jewellery or accessories.

Also out of v1: in-app notifications, analytics dashboards, and in the admin view, user management, bulk actions and editing someone else's listing.

## The AI rule

**The AI reads, drafts and flags. A person decides.**

1. **Photo to listing (seller).** Reads the photos and prefills brand, category, colour and condition. She can edit every field. It never suggests a price.
2. **Photo quality check (seller).** A separate call from photo to listing. Checks the photos are usable (sharp, well lit, whole item in frame, straight, and standing out from the background) and says so if not, but never blocks her from continuing.
3. **Natural-language search (buyer).** Turns a sentence like "black Sapphire kurta under 3000 in medium" into filter values, shown as applied filter chips she can adjust. Only call the model when the query is not a plain keyword match, and debounce it. If nothing matches, relax a filter and say which one was relaxed.
4. **Approval copilot (admin).** A short summary beside each pending listing: what the photos show, whether the stated brand looks consistent with the photos, whether the price is sane against the original, and any flaw in the description that is missing from the flaw field. A listing with brand `unknown` is normal and is never flagged. Only flag a brand the seller entered that the photos cannot back up, and only as a note for us, never a rejection.
5. **Catalogue-photo detection (admin).** Flags listings that look like a brand's studio photo instead of a real one. A flag in the queue only, never a rejection.

If a Gemini call fails or is slow, the flow carries on without it. AI failure never blocks a buyer or a seller.

### Seller AI calls: rules for Call 1 and Call 2

**Two separate Gemini calls, fired at the same time** (`lib/ai/runBoth.ts`, using `Promise.all`) so the seller only waits for the slower one.

**Call 1: `POST /api/ai/prefill`** (logic in `lib/ai/prefill.ts`)
- Input: 1 to 6 images as multipart form data (JPEG, PNG or WebP, up to 7 MB each). Nothing else: there is no `originalPrice`, because nothing uses it.
- The API accepts a single photo so the AI can read early, while she is still adding more. A finished *listing* still needs 2 to 6. Different rules, both correct.
- One Gemini call with all the images, structured output using `listingDraftSchema`, thinking level `LOW`, media resolution `MEDIUM`, 15 second timeout, one retry only on HTTP errors 429 or 503.
- `listingDraftSchema` fields: brand, brand_other, brand_evidence, brand_confidence, category, category_confidence, colour, condition, condition_confidence, flaws_seen, title_suggestion. Every list comes from `lib/constants.ts` and includes `unknown`. There is **no price field**: the model never sets a price.
- On validation failure or any error, return `{ ok: false }` with a short message. Never throw an unhandled error.

**Brand rules (in the system instruction, and enforced again on the server):**
- Labels are often cut out or missing, especially on leftover-store stock. If no label, tag or clear logo is visible, brand is `unknown`, `brand_evidence` is `none` and `brand_confidence` is `low`. Never guess a brand from style, embroidery or fabric.
- `brand_evidence` values: `label_visible` (readable neck or waist label, or logo), `tag_visible` (swing, price or care tag), `print_or_style_only`, `none`.
- A clearly visible woven logo or signature detail (for example a Levi's red tab or a Nike swoosh) counts as `label_visible`.
- Never fill `brand_other` with a guess. It is only for a brand name printed on a label that is not in our list.
- Server rule, whatever the model said: if `brand_evidence` is `print_or_style_only` or `none`, force `brand_confidence` to `low`. If it is `none`, also force `brand` to `unknown`.
- Pakistani labels are often small woven tags inside the neckline or trouser waistband, in English or Urdu script. Replicas are common.

**How suggestions appear to the seller:**
- High confidence: fill the field, marked "AI suggested".
- Medium confidence: fill the field and add "Please check".
- Low confidence or `unknown`: leave the field empty and show tappable "Could it be...?" chips.
- Suggestions fill empty fields only. Never overwrite something she has typed.
- Where possible show the evidence, for example "We read 'Khaadi' on the neck label".

**Price: the seller types it herself. We suggest nothing.**
- There is no suggested price, no price range and no pricing table. Removed deliberately: any guess we made would be invented rather than drawn from real sales.
- Revisit once there are enough real listings to work from. Until then the app must not imply it knows what an item is worth.

**Call 2: `POST /api/ai/photo-quality`** (logic in `lib/ai/photo-quality.ts`)
- Same input format. Uses `photoQualitySchema`: per photo, `photo_index`, `blurry`, `dark`, `busy_background`, `blends_into_background`, `item_cropped`, `crooked`. Overall, `overall_usable` (true or false) and one short `retake_tip` in plain English.
- `busy_background` and `blends_into_background` are deliberately separate: a patterned bedsheet is clutter, a white shirt on a white sheet is invisible. Different problems, different advice.
- `retake_tip` names the fix ("move somewhere with a plain background"), not just the fault. It never scolds and never implies she must redo anything.
- Thinking level `LOW`, media resolution `MEDIUM` (it needs enough detail to judge sharpness).
- The prompt must say: label or flaw close-ups are not "cropped", judge each photo independently, be lenient on plain fabric, never comment on people.
- Advisory only. It returns flags and a tip and never blocks anything. On any error return `{ ok: true, flags: [], skipped: true }`.
- The result will be saved in `Photo.quality_flags`. Not wired up yet: there is no Firestore in the project so far.
- The model does not reliably return one entry per photo. Never assume `flags.length === photos.length`, and match on `photo_index`.

**Photo tips shown on the upload screen** (`PHOTO_TIPS` in `lib/constants.ts`): daylight, plain background, the whole item in frame, a close-up of any flaw, and "If there is a label or tag, take a close-up of it."

**Photos are prepared in the browser before upload** (`lib/photos.ts`)
- Phones hand over HEIC, which Chrome, Firefox and Edge cannot display, and 3-6 MB files. `preparePhotos()` converts HEIC to JPEG (`heic2any`, loaded only when a HEIC appears) and resizes to 1,600 px at quality 0.8 (`browser-image-compression`, in a worker). A 6 MB photo becomes about 0.2 MB.
- This also strips EXIF, so a seller's home GPS location never leaves her phone.
- It never throws. If conversion or resizing fails, the original photo is kept and a `problem` message is set.
- **File pickers must use `accept="image/*"`. Never list `image/heic`:** Safari 17+ then converts JPEGs *into* HEIC, creating the problem we are solving.
- The server limits (`lib/ai/images.ts`: 1-6 photos, JPEG/PNG/WebP, 7 MB each) are unchanged and still enforced. The browser makes photos usable; the server is what makes them trusted.

**Current status of the AI routes (temporary):**
- `/api/ai/prefill` and `/api/ai/photo-quality` have no sign-in check and no spending protection yet. Run them on a laptop only. Do not deploy them publicly until sign-in, App Check, rate limits and budget alerts are added (see `docs/seller-flow-research.md`, milestone M6). If they must be deployed sooner, add a temporary secret-header check first.
- Photos are sent inline in the request. Cloud Storage upload comes later. Browser-side conversion and resizing are done (`lib/photos.ts`).
- Later milestone: log each AI read (what the AI suggested, what the seller finally submitted) so we can measure accuracy. Ask before creating that collection.
- Accuracy testing: `eval/items.csv` does not exist yet. Once it does, re-run `scripts/try-prefill.ts` after every prompt change.

## What is actually built (as of 2 October 2026, branch `foundations`)

Everything else in this file is the plan, not the code. Do not assume a file exists because it is described here.

**Working and tested end to end:**
- `lib/ai/client.ts`, `GET /api/health/gemini` — Gemini on Vertex AI, location `global`, via Application Default Credentials
- `lib/constants.ts` — brands (40 + `other` + `unknown`), 13 categories, 4 conditions, 5 photo tips, clothes and shoe sizes with `SIZE_OPTIONS` per category, 33 cities + `other`
- `app/globals.css` + `app/layout.tsx` — every token from `design-system.md`, the type scale as `.text-*` classes, Fraunces and Inter self-hosted via `next/font/google`. Verified in the browser: tokens resolve, the type scale matches the spec, and both of Fraunces' variable axes (`opsz` and weight) are live
- `design-system.md`, `components.html` — Bismah's design system and the 25-component visual reference
- `components/ui/` — the 8 shared components, ported from `components.html` with its class names unchanged: `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`, `TextLink`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `FilterChip` (+ `ChipRow`), `StatusChip`, `BottomSheet`. Checked in a browser against the showcase
- `components/seller/` — `PhotoGrid` (+ `PhotoSlot`) and `ConditionPicker`, ported from `components.html` sections 10 and 11. The grid is both the uploader and the cover picker, because the showcase draws them as two states of one grid. Photo count limits for a *listing* are `MIN_LISTING_PHOTOS`/`MAX_LISTING_PHOTOS` in `lib/constants.ts`, deliberately separate from the AI call's `MIN_PHOTOS`/`MAX_PHOTOS` in `lib/ai/images.ts`
- `app/sell/` — **the whole seller flow, photo first, with both Gemini calls wired in.** Four steps in one component (`SellFlow.tsx`), not four routes, because the photos only exist as object URLs in the tab and a navigation would throw them away:
  - **intro** — the five-step photo guide. First listing only, remembered in `localStorage` under `reloved.sell.guide-seen`, then always reachable from "How to photograph it" on the photos step
  - **photos** — `capture="environment"` opens the phone's own camera; a second input without `capture` and with `multiple` opens the gallery. **There is no viewfinder of ours**, deliberately. Then `PhotoGrid` for the cover picker
  - **reading** — both routes posted at once from `aiRequests.ts`, one progress row per call, each ticking when that call actually lands. No invented third step. The way out is a text link, promoted to a button after 15 seconds
  - **details** — `SellForm.tsx`, part filled, every AI answer marked
  - The form's values live in `SellFlow`, not in `SellForm`, so editing photos and coming back does not wipe what she typed. `mergePrefill` in `types.ts` is where "suggestions fill empty fields only" is actually enforced, and an edited field drops its "AI suggested" marker
  - Tested end to end against real Gemini: brand read off a label with the evidence line, a dark photo flagged with the model's own retake tip, a failed read, and a hanging call skipped. **Nothing persists:** the write needs Firebase
- `app/sell/prefillToForm.ts` — the confidence rules in one place: high fills and marks, medium fills and says "please check", low leaves the field empty and offers a "Could it be...?" chip, `unknown` offers nothing
- `components/seller/PhotoSource.tsx`, `PhotoGuide.tsx`, `GuideIllustration.tsx` — new. **The five guide drawings are placeholders**: line SVGs built from the tokens, waiting on Amna's reference screenshots. Swapping them is a change to `GuideIllustration.tsx` alone
- `app/dev/ui/` — gallery of the above, for comparing against `components.html`. 404s in production, verified
- `lib/ai/schemas.ts` — both response schemas with matching Zod checks
- `POST /api/ai/prefill` + `lib/ai/prefill.ts` — Call 1, including the server-side brand rules
- `POST /api/ai/photo-quality` + `lib/ai/photo-quality.ts` — Call 2, all six flags
- `lib/ai/runBoth.ts` — fires both at once. No HTTP route of its own yet, on purpose
- `lib/photos.ts` — browser HEIC conversion and resizing
- `app/dev/prefill/` — manual test page. Returns 404 in production, verified
- `scripts/try-prefill.ts` — runs a folder of photos and prints a table

**Not built at all yet:** Firebase (auth, Firestore, Storage), `components/seller/`, `components/buyer/`, `components/admin/`, every real screen, the buyer side, admin, natural-language search, the approval copilot, catalogue-photo detection, the colour list, `eval/items.csv`.

**Deliberate changes from `components.html`, flagged for Bismah.** The PRD has the full list under "Changes since this document was written", including the product-level ones. The visual ones:
- `FilterChip` is a `<button>`, not a `<div>`. A div cannot be tabbed to, activated with the keyboard, or announced as a control. Visually identical.
- `BottomSheet` is `position: fixed` in a portal, not `position: absolute`. In `components.html` it sits inside a `.phone-frame` mock, which only exists in that static page. It also gained `max-width: 480px` and `max-height: 90vh` with scroll, which the 375px mock never needed.
- **`.bottom-sheet-actions` stacks vertically.** `components.html` sets `display: flex` with no direction, so the two CTAs sit side by side. `design-system.md` says "Never side-by-side". The design system won. **The two files contradict each other here, so one of them needs fixing.**
- Three off-scale font sizes (`--size-sheet-body` 15px, `--size-meta` 13px, `--size-micro` 11px) were tokenised. `design-system.md` specifies the values but does not name them.
- `TextLink` renders a real `<a>` when given `href`. `components.html` only has the `<button>` form, but two of its uses ("View my listings", "List another item") navigate.
- States added that `design-system.md` specifies but `components.html` has no CSS for: `:disabled` on inputs, textareas and chips, the error border on `.textarea`, and suppressing the hover invert on a disabled button.
- `ConditionPicker` rows are a `<label>` around a visually hidden real `<input type="radio">`, not `<div>`s. That buys native radio behaviour: arrow keys move between options, only one can be chosen, and a screen reader announces "2 of 4". The focus ring is drawn on the row with `:has(:focus-visible)` since the input itself is hidden.
- `PhotoSlot` and its overlay controls are `<button>`s, not `<div>`s. The remove control is a sibling positioned over the slot rather than a child, because a button cannot contain another button.
- Photo grid additions `components.html` mocks with inline styles or omits: `.photo-slot.is-placeholder` for the dimmed empty cells, `.photo-slot-img` for the actual photo, and `.photo-slot-problem` for a quiet per-photo note when `preparePhotos` kept the original. All advisory, none blocking.
- **`ReplicaPicker` is provisional and needs a design.** None of the 25 sections has a checkbox or a yes/no control, so it reuses the condition picker's rows unchanged. It is deliberately two options rather than one tick: the PRD calls `is_replica` a "required declaration", and an unticked box is indistinguishable from a question she never read. Bismah to confirm or replace.
- `Select` is lifted from `.select-input` in section 20 (the report form), the only dropdown drawn anywhere. It lives in `components/ui/` because the report form and browse filters need it too. Added `:disabled` and `.input-error` states to match `.input`.
- `Input`, `Textarea` and `Select` take a `ReactNode` label, not just a string, so a label can carry an "(optional)" span.
- **The sell flow has no design in `components.html` at all.** Everything added for it says in its CSS comment which existing pattern it is built from: the photo guide rows and the reading rows both come from `.condition-option`'s "marker, then a label and a description" shape. Bismah to review `.sell-step`, `.photo-guide`, `.reading-*`, `.ai-mark` and `.quality-thumbs`.
- **AI suggestions are marked with words, not colour.** `design-system.md` rules out an accent, so a filled field gets a `--status-pending` line reading "AI suggested" or "AI suggested, please check", and the brand's evidence line sits under it in the quieter hint colour.
- **`BRAND_LABELS` gained display names** for the eight brands that Title Case gets wrong (`hm` to "H&M", `levis` to "Levi's"). `brandLabel()` and `categoryLabel()` in `lib/constants.ts` derive the rest.
- **`PHOTO_GUIDE` added to `lib/constants.ts`**, next to `PHOTO_TIPS`. Same five tips with a title, a line of why, and the name of a drawing. `PHOTO_TIPS` stays the short form.

**The condition scale was a real conflict, now settled.** `components.html` had Brand new / Excellent / Very good / Good, where "Excellent" meant "no tags, worn a few times". The PRD and `lib/constants.ts` say `brand_new_without_tags` means "no tags, never worn". Different items, not different wording. **The PRD wins**; Amna is updating `components.html`. Do not change `CONDITION_VALUES` or `CONDITIONS` in `lib/constants.ts`: they also feed the Gemini prefill schema.

**Known gaps, decided deliberately — do not "fix" without asking:**
- There is no suggested price anywhere. See the Price section above.
- `original_price` is still a **Listing** field the seller types herself, shown to buyers and used by the admin copilot. The AI prefill call no longer takes an `originalPrice` parameter. These are different things: do not delete the Listing field.
- A 504 from Gemini is **not** retried; only 429 and 503 are. A real 504 has been seen in testing. Open question.
- Photos have only ever been tested against generated test images, never real clothing. **The prompts are unproven.** Testing with real garment photos is the next useful thing anyone can do.
- `lib/pricing.ts` and `lib/pricing-table.ts` were deleted on purpose. Do not recreate them.

## Users and permissions

- **Buyer:** browses and searches with no account. Creates an email-only account the first time she taps Message seller. Never ask a buyer for a phone number. Never show view or contact counts to buyers.
- **Seller:** the account is created at submit, not before (Path 1, step 7). Email verified by link, phone verified by code. If the phone code fails, she continues with email alone. A broken code service must never block a listing. Changing her phone clears `phone_verified_at` and re-triggers verification.
- **Admin:** a user with `is_admin` set to true. There is no role field.
- Enforce permissions on the server and in Firestore security rules, never only by hiding buttons.

See the PRD table "What each user sees on a listing" for exactly which fields each user sees.

## Data model

Six entities: User, Listing, Photo, ContactEvent, ModerationAction, Report.
Full field lists are in the PRD under "Domain model". Do not add, rename or remove fields without asking.

- **Listing status:** `pending`, `live`, `rejected`, `sold`, `expired`, `hidden`. Only admins set `live` and `rejected`. Browse shows `live` only, newest first.
- **Listing colour:** `colour` is a Listing field, used by photo to listing and by search.
- **Listing brand:** one value from the brand list, including `other` (with `brand_other`) and `unknown`. See Fixed lists.
- Sold count is computed from the seller's listings at `sold`. Never store it.
- **ModerationAction** is append-only and written for exactly four events: approved, rejected, hidden, restored. Marking sold or expiring writes no row.
- **ContactEvent** is one record per WhatsApp tap by an email-verified buyer. Maximum 10 per buyer per day, enforced on the server. This is the week 3 success metric.
- **Reports:** two unresolved reports auto-hide the listing and write a `hidden` ModerationAction with `admin_id` null.
- **Photos:** two to six per listing, enforced at submit. Exactly one cover, chosen by the seller. `quality_flags` are advisory only and never block submission.
- Prices are whole numbers in Pakistani rupees (PKR). Phone numbers are stored in E.164 format (the international format, for example +923001234567).
- `expires_at` is `created_at` plus 30 days.
- Listings and their status are written only by the server (Admin SDK), never directly from the browser.

## Fixed lists (all live in `lib/constants.ts`)

- **Categories:** kurta, pret, co_ord_set, dupatta, dress, top, bottoms, jeans, skirt, jacket, sportswear, shoes, bag
- **Sizes:** clothes XS to XL (`CLOTHING_SIZES`), shoes UK 3 to 9 (`SHOE_SIZES`). **Bags and dupattas have no size at all** and show no size field: `SIZE_OPTIONS` maps both to `null`. `SIZE_OPTIONS` is a full `Record<Category, ...>`, so adding a category without deciding its sizes fails the type check
- **Condition** (always shown with its description):
  - `brand_new_with_tags`: Brand new with tags, "With tags, never worn"
  - `brand_new_without_tags`: Brand new without tags, "No tags, never worn"
  - `very_good`: Very good, "Well worn, but still in great shape"
  - `fair`: Fair, "Shows some signs of wear — please photograph the areas that show it"
- **Listing status** (`LISTING_STATUSES`, with `LISTING_STATUS_LABELS` for display): pending, live, rejected, sold, expired, hidden. `StatusChip` renders them. Sellers see a neutral amber "Needs attention" instead of the red Rejected chip on my-listings, per `components.html`: that variant is not built yet
- **Rejection reasons:** bad_photos, missing_details, not_allowed, suspected_counterfeit
- **Report reasons:** counterfeit, not_as_described, inappropriate, spam
- **Brands:**
  - Pakistani: khaadi, sapphire, generation, elan, gul_ahmed, ideas_by_gul_ahmed, alkaram_studio, limelight, nishat_linen, maria_b, sana_safinaz, outfitters, bonanza_satrangi, beechtree, zellbury, junaid_jamshed, ethnic, cross_stitch, baroque, asim_jofa, crimson, mausummery, agha_noor, faiza_saqlain, breakhouse
  - Western and international: zara, hm, mango, levis, nike, adidas, puma, bershka, pull_and_bear, stradivarius, marks_and_spencer, tommy_hilfiger, calvin_klein, forever_21, shein
  - Special values: `other` and `unknown`
  - **`unknown` means the seller (or the AI) cannot tell the brand.** Its label for sellers is "Not sure / no label". Tags are often cut out, especially on leftover-store stock, so this is a normal choice and never an error. It is different from `other`, which means a brand that is not on the list and comes with `brand_other`.
  - **Buyer side:** an item with brand `unknown` shows no brand chip on its card or detail page (never the word "Unknown"), and `unknown` is left out of the brand filter options and out of natural-language search brand matching. An item with brand `other` shows its `brand_other` text.
  - The brand list will change as we see the real seed items. It lives only in `lib/constants.ts`. Never copy it into another file.
- **Cities:** 33 major Pakistani cities, roughly largest first so the common answers sit at the top of the dropdown. All four provincial capitals, Islamabad, plus the Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan centres. `CITIES` is a `{ value, label }` list because several names are multi-word (`rahim_yar_khan` to "Rahim Yar Khan").
  - **`other` is last** and means a town that is not on the list. The north star is a woman *anywhere* in Pakistan, so the list must never be a dead end.
  - **`other` has no free-text companion field yet.** It needs `city_other` on Listing, mirroring `brand_other`. That is a domain model change, so it needs a PRD update and Bismah's agreement first, because buyers see the city on browse and item detail.
- **Colours:** TODO: add the list. Note that Call 1 already returns a `colour` value and `Listing.colour` is in the PRD, so this list is a real gap, not a nicety

## Design rules

- Mobile-first. Build for a phone-width screen first, then scale up.
- Minimal and close to black and white. No coloured buttons or calls to action: the clothes in the photos carry the colour.
- **`design-system.md` is the source of truth for everything visual.** Read it before styling anything. Colours, type scale, spacing, radius, focus states, motion, z-index, voice and tone all live there. `components.html` is the matching visual reference: a standalone page showing all 25 components. Both were written by Bismah and are **shared** — ask before changing either.
- Use design tokens only. Never hard-code a colour value or font size. Every token from `design-system.md` is in `app/globals.css` as a CSS custom property, plus `.text-h1` to `.text-ui` classes for the type scale.
- Component names and CSS class names match `components.html` exactly, so either file can be used to find the other. Per-component CSS is lifted from it as each component is built, not rewritten.
- Reuse existing components. Never create a new button, card or input when one exists. If a variant is needed, ask. If `components.html` has no design for something, stop and ask rather than inventing one.
- No dark mode in v1, and no `prefers-color-scheme` handling. See `design-system.md`.
- No em dashes in copy or UI strings (`design-system.md`). The one in the `fair` condition description in `lib/constants.ts` predates that rule and is a known exception.
- AI suggestions must look clearly different from what the seller typed ("AI suggested" or "Please check"), and must be easy to change or clear.
- Photo quality messages are calm and helpful ("This one looks a bit dark. Retake it?") with two equal choices, Retake and Keep it. Never disable the Next button.
- WhatsApp message, prefilled: "Hi, I'm interested in your [item title] on Reloved."
